description: Iâ€™m a Senior Staff Engineer for Nagarro, a software developer focused on software solutions. In this role, I am a part of the development team to design and develop .Net applications. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is working with the client or business unit leader to understand his or her business objectives.
